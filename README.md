# Daily DSA in Java 🚀

This repository contains my daily Data Structures & Algorithms practice in Java.

## Structure
- Problems are organized by topic (Arrays, Strings, etc.)
- Each file includes:
  - Initial mistakes
  - Correct approach
  - Time & space complexity
  - Edge cases

## Goal
- Build strong problem-solving fundamentals
- Focus on clarity of thought, not just answers
